"""
In Python, operators are special symbols or keywords used to perform operations on values and variables, 
which are called operands

#1. arithmatic operators 

print(23+56)      #this operator is used for sum
print(23-56)      #this operator is used for subtraction 
print(23*56)      #this operator is used for multiply
print(23/56)      #this operator is used for division 
print(23//56)     #this operator is used for floor division 
print(23%56)      #this operator is used for modulo 
print(3**3)       #this operator is used for power 

#2. assignment operators

a = 1 # so the 1 is assigned to a means that the value of a is 1

b = 2 # so the 2 is assigned to b means that the value of b is 2

"""its like box a and b and we are putting a balls have number like 1 and 2 and its stored the value of balls"""

#3. use assignment operators with arithmatic operators 

a = 5  #sign 5 in a veriable 
a*=2   # this means 5*2 = 10
a/=5   # this means 10 
a+=23
print(a)
